The Moon acts as a mirror, reflecting sunlight towards Earth. Though it doesn't produce
its own light, the Moon shines because its surface reflects sunlight. This reflection
causes the phases of the Moon, which change as it orbits Earth. Other celestial bodies,
like planets, also reflect sunlight to varying degrees.

Trees typically have more leaves on the southern side (in the Northern Hemisphere)
because that side receives more sunlight. This increased exposure to sunlight
allows for more photosynthesis, leading to denser foliage.   In the Southern Hemisphere,
the opposite occurs, with the northern side of trees having more leaves. However, factors like local
environmental conditions and tree species can also   influence leaf distribution.
